## What I learned

I practiced using useEffect again. I learned what the second arg of useEffect actually did. It 
is a dependancy array which basically means that once the variable array changes, useeffect will run.

I also used .map to iterate the amount of buttons.

Cool project overall, defintely couldve done more with it, but kept it simple.
